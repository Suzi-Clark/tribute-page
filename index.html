            Amelia Earhart wrote a range of magazine articles, newspaper columns and essays during her lifetime, as well as publishing two books: <i>20 Hrs. 40 Min.: Our Flight in the Friendship</i> (1928) and <i>The Fun of It</i> (1932). A third and final book called <i>Last Flight</i> (1937) was published after her disappearance earlier that year. <i>Last Flight</i> was compiled by her husband from journal entries Earhart had been sending back to the USA during her world flight attempt.
          <br>
            These days, Amelia Earhart is fondly remembered not just for her achievements in the field of aviation, but also for her contribution to early 20th century feminism including her instrumental role in the foundation of the Nintey-Nines, an organisation for female pilots that still exists today.
